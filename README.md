# Abstract vs Concrete Fusion

## Motivation:

Inspired by a [dual coding theory](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315798868) paradigm. The main idea for abstract vs concrete aware fusion design is:
1. Increases in retreival
2. Stuff

## Relevant Datasets:

Word datasets that are currently implemented and handled are:
* MT40k
* CSLB
* USF
* MRC
* SimLex999
* Vinson
* McRae
* SimVerb
* imSitu 
* CP
* TWP
* Battig
* EViLBERT
* Cortese

## To Get:

Datasets I havent found yet I need to integrate:
* “Formal Distinctiveness of High- and Low-Imageability Nouns:Analyses and Theoretical Implications”
* “Estimating the visual variety of concepts by referring to Webpopularity”
