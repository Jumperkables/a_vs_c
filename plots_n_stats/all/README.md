## 2_improved_concreteness_distribution
The regeneration of concreteness distrubution for TVQA with the improved norm dictionary. While we're at it we include the AVSD and PVSE datasets too.
* The relative concreteness of the vocabularies of each dataset.
* The concreteness distribution across **features** (e.g. visual-concepts, subtitles, questions, answers, correct answers...).
* New ranges are scaled between 0-1 now. Unlike the likert scale between 1-7 from before when using only MRC norms
