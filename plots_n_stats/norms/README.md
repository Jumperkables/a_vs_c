# Norms
Here we have our documentation of norms and the way that they cluster. The aim for this is to identify categorical and associative neighbourhoods down which we can train a network in a few separate ways.

## 6_assoc_clusters
Using the USF free association norms (AMONG OTHERS MAYBE), we identify clusters of associations in a network with a norm score above certain thresholds
