## 0_vocab_manipulation
The initial experiments we started with for concrete-vs-abstract in TVQA. This was removing words from the TVQA vocabulary of a certain level of abstractness and concreteness.
* Late September - Early October.
* Used concreteness and imagability norms from MRC database only, on a likert scale of 1-7.
* During these experiments we removed stopwords from consideration, resulting in noticable performance differences.

## 1_data_concreteness_distribution
The follow up experiments determining the relative distribtion of concreteness and imagability in TVQA.
* Early October
* As in 0, uses only MRC norms, range 1-7.
* Contains the concreteness distribution across the TVQA datasets in its different areas.
